# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis

This project implements and analyzes the performance of different sorting algorithms in Python by measuring their execution times and generating a comparative graph.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Implementation of **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.
- Random list generation for performance testing.
- Execution time measurement for each algorithm.
- Visualization of results with graphs.
- Unit testing to validate algorithm correctness.
- Code coverage measurement.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **Unittest** (for testing)
- **Coverage.py** (for coverage analysis)

---

## Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## âœ… Run tests with coverage

```sh
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## ðŸ“Š Generate coverage report:
```sh
coverage report -m
```

##  Executing the Main Script
```sh
python main.py
```
